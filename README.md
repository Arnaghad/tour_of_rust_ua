# Tour of Rust

Welcome to the source repository of [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/).

# Goals

This project is designed to provide experienced programmers with a swift introduction to Rust, serving as an alternative to reading extensive book-style documentation.

* Chapter 1 - The Basics
* Chapter 2 - Basic Control Flow
* Chapter 3 - Basic Data Structure Types
* Chapter 4 - Generic Types
* Chapter 5 - Ownership & Borrowing Data
* Chapter 6 - Text
* Chapter 7 - Object-Oriented Programming
* Chapter 8 - Smart Pointers
* Chapter 9 - Project Organization and Structure

Content goals:
* Chapters 1-4 should give a strong impression of Rust's aesthetic.
* Chapters 1-6 should provide C programmers with a solid understanding of how their ideas translate into Rust.
* Chapters 1-8 should provide C++ programmers with a strong grasp of Rust equivalents.
* Chapter 9+ covers Rust-specific concepts that don‚Äôt fit neatly into the earlier sections.

This project also aims to make this book available in as many languages as possible.

# Looking for Translators!

If you‚Äôd like to contribute translations for a new language, feel free to submit a PR!

Check the `lessons` folder for your language. Each chapter has its own file. You can modify an existing translation or create a new one based on the English version.

## How to Run the Project Locally

To run the site locally, install `yq`. We use [this version](https://kislyuk.github.io/yq/).

Run `yarn` to install JavaScript dependencies.

After installation, use `make` to start the site. Restart the server after making changes to see them live.
Windows users should use `make.bat`.
